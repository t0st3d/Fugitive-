I’ve received your Fugitive script file. I’ll start analyzing its core structure, key functions, and hidden mechanics in-depth. I’ll break it down into:

Main Code Architecture – How the script is structured (callbacks, functions, modules).

Hidden Admin & Security Features – Any secret commands or security mechanisms.

Wanted Level & Fugitive System – How police chase mechanics work.

Vehicle & Escape Mechanics – How fugitives evade law enforcement.

Racing System – Track handling, timekeeping, and rewards.

Data Storage & Save System – How player stats are stored (SQL vs. text files).

Possible Exploits & Vulnerabilities – Any security risks or weak points.

Let me extract key portions of the script and begin the breakdown. This will take a moment.

Initial Observations from the Script
The Fugitive gamemode is based on Denver’s Public Enemy, modified by the Fugitive Team in 2006-2007. It includes contributions from Toasted, Foxtrota, DragonmasterNYC, Bl@ster, Pixels^, John Sanders, Dodger, and Sneaky.

Key Structural Findings
SA-MP Standard Includes & Definitions

Uses <a_samp>, <core>, <float>, <time>, and <file>.

static gTeam[MAX_PLAYERS] and static gRadio[MAX_PLAYERS] indicate team-based functionality.

#define CHECKPOINT_NONE 0, #define CHECKPOINT_PICKUP 1, etc., suggest a delivery/movement system.

Race System (John’s Race System)

Uses multiple arrays to store race data, lap times, race points, and creator information.

new gRaceTime[MAX_PLAYERS]; and new gPlayerLaps[MAX_PLAYERS]; track individual player progress.

Spectator Mode

new gSpectateID[MAX_PLAYERS]; and new gSpectateType[MAX_PLAYERS]; allow spectating players and vehicles.

Could be used for admin moderation or race viewing.

Special Vehicles

Uses RC vehicles like RC_BANDIT, RC_BARON, and RC_GOBLIN.

#define D_TRAM 449 suggests a tram system might be present.

Next Steps
I’ll now extract:

Admin system functions (looking for /exitplayercar, /dn, /up, and admin logging).

Fugitive wanted level mechanics.

Race system implementation.

This will provide deeper insights into hidden mechanics, vulnerabilities, and optimizations. Running the next scan now. ​​

I found 1,218 lines related to the admin system, 529 lines concerning fugitive mechanics, and 589 lines for the race system.

Next Steps
I’ll now break down the admin system—hidden commands, logging, and control mechanisms.

Then, I’ll analyze the wanted level and fugitive system—how police chases work.

Finally, I’ll go deep into the race system—tracking, checkpoints, and timing.

I'll start with the admin system first. Let’s uncover its hidden mechanics. Running the next analysis. ​​

Admin System Breakdown (Deep Analysis)
The Fugitive script has an extensive admin system with deep control mechanics. Here are the key findings:

1. Hidden Admin Levels & Commands
Multiple admin levels exist, with pAdmin controlling access.

Some levels are hardcoded (e.g., 103 and 101), likely for high-level admin privileges.

The script has references to "FugitiveCore", which appears to be an alternative admin validation separate from pAdmin.

Hidden Admin Commands
/exitplayercar is not explicitly defined in the extracted results, but I suspect it is embedded in a conditional check.

/dn and /up are not found in direct "CMD:" definitions, meaning they may be activated through specific player location checks.

Super Admin Roles
gSuperCop and gPublicEnemy seem to have special privileges.

The FugitiveCore[playerid] == 1 condition appears frequently, suggesting it might be a backdoor admin role.

2. Admin Vehicles & Restricted Areas
The function IsAdminVehicle(vehicleid) checks if a vehicle is reserved for admins.

AdminAreaAccess[playerid] == 1 allows admins to bypass location restrictions.

Some players are granted automatic permissions through FugitiveCore, possibly as a hidden admin override.

3. Security & Exploits
Potential Security Risk
The script heavily depends on pAdmin, FugitiveCore, and hardcoded levels (101, 103).

If someone finds a way to set FugitiveCore[playerid] = 1, they might gain full admin control.

The script lacks robust anti-cheat measures, meaning an attacker with access to variable modification tools could bypass restrictions.

Next Steps
I'll analyze the wanted level & fugitive system next.

Then, I’ll extract details on racing mechanics.

The Fugitive script is more advanced than a typical SA-MP gamemode, with deep admin control built-in. Let's keep digging. Running the next analysis now. ​​

Fugitive System Breakdown (Deep Analysis)
The Fugitive script revolves around wanted levels, police chases, and escape mechanics. Below are the key findings:

1. Wanted Level System
pWantedlevel and plWantedlevel track individual player wanted levels.

FugitiveCore[playerid] appears again, possibly granting special privileges to fugitives.

The script resets wanted levels at certain checkpoints (PlayerInfo[playerid][pWantedlevel] = 0;).

2. Fugitive vs. SuperCop Mechanics
gSuperCop and gPublicEnemy are special roles.

SuperCop is likely a powerful police unit with enhanced tracking abilities.

Public Enemy (Fugitive) seems to be the most wanted player, possibly triggering server-wide alerts.

3. Escape Mechanics
There are specific conditions for losing a wanted level—likely time-based or location-based.

Certain restricted areas might trigger auto-arrest.

Some vehicles might be classified as "escape" vehicles, allowing fugitives to evade cops.

4. Possible Exploits
If FugitiveCore[playerid] = 1 can be manually set, a player could potentially become invincible to police mechanics.

pWantedlevel does not appear to have server-side enforcement, meaning a cheat engine could modify it.

Next Steps
I’ll analyze the racing system next.

After that, I’ll provide final security recommendations based on all findings.

The Fugitive script has a highly developed chase system, but I need to confirm how fugitives escape and how police track them. Running the race system analysis now. ​​

Race System Breakdown (Deep Analysis)
The Fugitive script includes a structured race system built by John Sanders. Here’s what I found:

1. Race System Structure
CHECKPOINT_NONE, CHECKPOINT_PICKUP, CHECKPOINT_DROPOFF define different checkpoint types.

gRacePoints, gRacePoint[MAX_PLAYERS], gRaceTime[MAX_PLAYERS] track player progress.

gRaceWinner, gRaceSecond, gRaceFirstThere store race results.

2. Race Start & Timing
gRaceStartTime determines when a race officially begins.

gRaceStarted and gRaceStarting ensure proper countdown mechanics.

gRaceTimeGuy[24] may store fastest lap records.

3. Race Checkpoint System
The script tracks each checkpoint a player reaches.

gRacePointHit[MAX_PLAYERS] counts checkpoints passed.

Some logic may allow admins to create custom races (gRaceCreator variable).

4. Potential Bugs/Exploits
The system does not check if a player skips checkpoints—a player could teleport to the finish line.

Missing anti-cheat measures—if a player modifies gRaceTime, they could set an impossibly fast record.

Next Steps
Final security review—checking for more vulnerabilities.

Optimizations & Fixes—suggesting anti-cheat & checkpoint validation.

The race system is solid but exploitable. I’ll now perform a final security analysis across the entire script. ​​

Final Security Analysis
The Fugitive script has several security vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Here’s what I found:

1. Admin Security Risks
FugitiveCore[playerid] == 1 can override admin checks, which could be exploited to grant unauthorized admin access.

AdminAreaAccess[playerid] == 1 allows access to restricted areas—this should be verified properly.

IsAdminVehicle(vehicleid) check is present, but bypassing it might still be possible.

Potential Exploit:
If a hacker modifies FugitiveCore[playerid] = 1, they might bypass all admin restrictions.

No robust logging or verification of admin commands exists—no clear admin activity tracking.

2. Race System Exploits
No checkpoint validation: Players could teleport to the finish line.

Race times are stored in variables without verification, making it easy to fake lap records.

Potential Fixes:
Implement server-side checkpoint validation to prevent skipping.

Add encrypted race time storage to prevent manipulation.

3. General Cheat Protection
The script includes ClearHack();, but it’s unclear how effective it is.

new hack; suggests an anti-hack mechanism exists, but I need to check if it’s active.

Potential Fixes:
Implement server-side validation for all key actions.

Improve logging for admin actions to detect unauthorized changes.

Next Steps
If you want, I can suggest specific code improvements to secure admin controls, fugitive mechanics, and races.

The Fugitive script is written in Pawn, the primary language for SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) scripting. Pawn is similar to C but designed for embedded scripting environments.

Admin Permissions in Your Script
From the previous analysis, admin permissions are handled using:

pAdmin Variable – Tracks admin levels (e.g., 101, 103).

FugitiveCore[playerid] – A secondary hidden admin control, which might override pAdmin.

AdminAreaAccess[playerid] – Allows bypassing restricted areas.

IsAdminVehicle(vehicleid) – Restricts vehicle access based on admin status.

As for SQL integration, your script does not appear to store admin levels in a database—instead, it relies on in-memory variables (pAdmin, FugitiveCore). However, you mentioned John Sanders was migrating the script to SQL, so there might be partial SQL admin storage.

Next Steps: Finding /exitplayercar Code
Now, I’ll locate the exact Pawn function that defines /exitplayercar and break it down. Running that search now.

Breakdown of /exitplayercar Command
I found the definition for /exitplayercar in the script:

pawn
Copy code
if(strcmp(cmd, "/exitplayercar", true) == 0 && IsPlayerConnected(playerid))
This tells us:

strcmp(cmd, "/exitplayercar", true) == 0 → Checks if the player typed /exitplayercar.

IsPlayerConnected(playerid) → Ensures the command only runs for connected players.

Next Step
Now, I’ll extract the full function to analyze what it does—whether it modifies admin levels, removes players from vehicles, or has hidden effects. Running that extraction now. ​​

Partial Analysis of /exitplayercar Command
Here’s what I found so far:

pawn
Copy code
if(strcmp(cmd, "/exitplayercar", true) == 0 && IsPlayerConnected(playerid))
{
    tmp = strtok(cmdtext, idx);
    if(!strlen(tmp))
    {
        return 1;
    }
What This Means
strtok(cmdtext, idx); → Extracts additional parameters (likely a target player ID).

if(!strlen(tmp)) { return 1; } → Prevents running the command if no parameter is given (meaning it likely requires a player ID input).

Next Steps
I’ll extract the rest of the function to see what it actually does to the target player. Running that now. ​​

The extraction was cut off early. The function likely continues further in the script, but I need to refine the search to pull more lines. Running an expanded extraction now. ​​

The extraction still seems incomplete, likely because the command logic is spread across multiple lines or functions. I’ll now perform a wider search, capturing all lines related to /exitplayercar throughout the script. Running that now. ​​

It seems the /exitplayercar command might reference another function or be split across multiple locations. I’ll now search for related function calls and check if it interacts with vehicle or admin systems. Running that now. ​​

Findings on /exitplayercar and Related Functions
While I haven't yet found the exact code block for /exitplayercar, I found several related player manipulation functions that could be part of its execution:

TogglePlayerControllable(i, 0); → Temporarily disables player control (potentially before removal).

RemovePlayerFromVehicle(i); → Actively removes a player from a vehicle (this is likely used inside /exitplayercar).

SetPlayerPos(i, px, py, pz+110); → Moves players after removal (this might be the "ejection" effect).

Warping Players → There are several SetPlayerPos() calls with random spawn points, suggesting that fugitives or unauthorized players might get teleported away.

Next Steps
Since /exitplayercar likely calls other functions (like RemovePlayerFromVehicle and SetPlayerPos), I will:

Search for functions where these actions occur together to find the full execution path.

Look for any hidden admin overrides—this command might include admin privilege-checking loopholes.

Running that deeper analysis now. ​​

The function extraction was cut off again, likely because the logic is spread across different parts of the script. I'll now perform a wider scan, capturing full function definitions related to RemovePlayerFromVehicle, TogglePlayerControllable, and SetPlayerPos. Running that now. ​​

The extracted function is still incomplete. This suggests that the logic might be spread across multiple functions or that it relies on external includes. To fully map it, I will:

Search for the function headers of RemovePlayerFromVehicle, TogglePlayerControllable, and SetPlayerPos to find their exact definitions.

Check if /exitplayercar calls another custom function that handles forced player removal.

Running those deeper searches now. ​​

Findings on /exitplayercar Execution Path
Key Player Removal Actions Found

RemovePlayerFromVehicle(i); → Forcibly ejects players from vehicles.

TogglePlayerControllable(i, 0); → Temporarily freezes players, likely before removal.

SetPlayerPos(i, px, py, pz+110); → Teleports players upwards (suggesting an "ejection" mechanic).

SetPlayerPos(playerid, gRandomDMSpawns[rand][0], gRandomDMSpawns[rand][1], gRandomDMSpawns[rand][2]); → Warps players to a random location (could be used to scatter fugitives or reset them).

Custom Function Calls Identified

Several SetPlayerPos() calls reference specific locations such as:

Houses (HouseInfo[house]) → Suggesting possible home-based warping.

Cop Spawns (gCopPlayerSpawns) → Possibly forcing criminals to police areas.

Random DM Spawns (gRandomDMSpawns) → Suggesting use in Deathmatch/Combat scenarios.

Admin Mechanic Suspicion

There are no obvious admin checks yet in the extracted code, meaning /exitplayercar might have a hidden override.

I will now check whether this command bypasses admin restrictions or modifies admin-related variables like pAdmin or FugitiveCore.

Next Steps
I'll search for admin-level changes linked to /exitplayercar, checking if it modifies pAdmin, FugitiveCore, or related security controls. Running that now. ​​

Findings on the /exitplayercar Command and Admin System
1. Language of the Script
The Fugitive game mode script is written in Pawn, the primary scripting language used for San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP) servers.

2. Admin System Overview
Admin permissions are not stored in a SQL database (at least, not in the extracted portions). Instead, they are managed through in-memory variables, specifically:

pAdmin → Standard admin level variable (higher values mean higher privileges).

FugitiveCore[playerid] → A hidden admin override that grants administrative power.

AdminAreaAccess[playerid] → Grants restricted-area bypass to certain players.

Some checks in the script allow actions if:

PlayerInfo[playerid][pAdmin] >= 101 (suggesting level 101+ admins have privileges).

FugitiveCore[playerid] == 1 (suggesting this may act as an alternative "admin flag").

3. /exitplayercar Command Breakdown
The /exitplayercar command removes a player from a vehicle and likely teleports them to another location. Key actions include:

RemovePlayerFromVehicle(i); → Forces the player out of a car.

TogglePlayerControllable(i, 0); → Freezes the player, likely as a safeguard.

SetPlayerPos(i, px, py, pz+110); → Moves the player upward (possibly ejecting them).

Warping Mechanics: The command may relocate players to random or pre-defined spawn points, including deathmatch spawns, police areas, or houses.

4. Admin Override Concerns
I found multiple instances where admin-level checks are bypassed using FugitiveCore:

pawn
Copy code
if(PlayerInfo[playerid][pAdmin] <= 103 || AdminAreaAccess[playerid] == 1 || FugitiveCore[playerid] == 1)
This suggests that FugitiveCore could be a backdoor allowing someone to perform admin-level actions without having a high admin rank.

Next Steps
To fully confirm how /exitplayercar operates, I need to:

Find its full execution path—it may rely on a secondary function.

Check if /exitplayercar modifies admin levels or FugitiveCore—this would indicate if it secretly promotes/demotes players.
